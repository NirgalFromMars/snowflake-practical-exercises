-- SQL Concepts:
-- DATE_TRUNC() to group by month
-- AVG() for average monthly usage
-- LAG() to compare with the previous month
-- QUALIFY (âœ… Snowflake-specific feature)
-- WITH for CTEs (Common Table Expressions)

-- meter:
-- 0 -> electricity (kWh)
-- 1 -> cold water (gallons/m3)
-- 2 -> steam (pounds)
-- 3 -> hot water (gallons/m3)
